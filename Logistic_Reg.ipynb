        "*Question 1: What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: - Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.\n",
        "-\tLogistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable (or output), y, can take only discrete values for a given set of features (or inputs), X. Here, we predict the value by 1 or 0.\n",
        "-\t Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised regression algorithm. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Here, we predict the value by an integer number.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Question 2: Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The sigmoid function maps input values to a value between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification and logistic regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Question 3: What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: - Regularization, a mechanism for penalizing model complexity during training, is extremely important in logistic regression modeling. It is an important technique in machine learning that helps to improve model accuracy by preventing overfitting.\n",
        "- The primary objective of regularization is to strike a balance between fitting the training data accurately and ensuring that the model can make reliable predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Question 4: What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and why are they important?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: - Some of the common evaluation matrices for classification models are Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Log-loss etc.\n",
        "-\tEvaluation metrics quantify the performance of classification models in machine learning. They offer feedback for model refinement and aid in selecting the most suitable model for specific problems. Different problems value errors differently for example in fraud detection, missing a fraud (False Negative) might be worse than flagging an innocent transaction (False Positive).\n"
